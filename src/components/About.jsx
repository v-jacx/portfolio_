        <p className='text-sm text-justify mt-4 font-slab'>
                I'm Jacquelin Velasquez, but you can call me Jacquie.  My love for coding started in High School, when a recruiter came in to my pre-calculus class to give a presentation about working in STEM. I had never heard of computer science or coding.  Coming from a low income family where our parents didn't know anything about technology, meant our understanding of it was also minimal. After high school, I pursued my dream of becoming a programmer, but being a first generation college student, I felt lost and had no guidance. I tried working full-time and being a full-time student but slowly fell off. I joined the U.S. Navy in 2019, got married in 2020, and moved to North Carolina. I went back to college as my love for coding never disappeared. I was on the path to my associates degree although the pace was not what I wanted. I give my all to any job that I hold and thus took less courses than I wish I did. Shortly after having my first born baby, I decided to join a bootcamp and go all in. There was no going back. No quiting. And here I am a General Assembly bootcamp graduate with a love and passion for coding searching for her next opportunity to create great things, solve world problems and become part of an amazing community.
